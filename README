General Information
===================

The ADG library (Automatic Drawing Generation) is a set of functions focused
on automating the drawing of mechanical parts.

It is not a CAD system but a GObject based library providing a non-interactive
Cairo canvas where you can put common CAD entities, such as paths, xatches and
quotes, to create your technical drawings.

If you want to develop an application that needs to show and print drawings,
also complex, where some data change but the overall design is ever the same,
the ADG library is for you. In production factories, this is often a good
choice and can help to greatly improve the production in technical offices.

You can reach similar targets using parametric CADs, but a custom application
provides the following benefits:

o More customizable
o Quicker and not so bloated as a parametric CAD
o Can be easely connected to a database
o The drawings are generated on-fly: this feature can be used, for instance,
  in a dynamic site throught a web-based application

More informations can be found in docs/reference/html/index.html.

Installation
============

The adg library has the following dependencies:

o glib-2.10.1 or later (http://www.gtk.org)
o gcontainer v.1.99.1 or later (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gcontainer)
o cairo-1.0 or later (http://cairographics.org)

If you want some demo programs to be built, working in UI context, you
o gtk+ v.2.8 or later (http://www.gtk.org/)
