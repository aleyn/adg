General Information
===================

Automatic Drawing Generation is GObject-based library that provides a
non-interactive cairo canvas specifically designed for generating
technical drawings.

If you want to develop an application that needs to show and print drawings
where some data change but the overall design is always the same, the ADG
library comes in handy. In production factories, this is often a good
choice and could help to greatly improve the production of technical offices.

You can reach similar targets using parametric CADs but a custom application
provides the following benefits:

o More customizable
o Quicker and not so bloated as a parametric CAD
o Can be easily connected to a database
o The drawings are generated on-fly: this feature can be by
  web-based application
