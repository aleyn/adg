The following list is roughly in implementation order. All the improvements
must be reflected in the demo programs, where applicable.

Road to adg-0.4.0
=================

o Implement a basic AdgXatchStyle, derived from AdgLineStyle.
o Check if the flag management in AdgEntity is implemented properly.
* Try to avoid wrapping of cairo APIs in AdgPath.
o Optimize the implemented entities applying the 0.3 ADG infractrusture
  and enable caching where applicable.
o Add a "beyond" property to AdgDim, to be used in extending the baseline
  on outside arrows requested. If not specified, it must default to
  3 x arrow size.
o Add a three-state enum to adg-enums.h: ADG_THREE_STATE_OFF,
  ADG_THREE_STATE_ON and ADG_THREE_STATE_DEFAULT.
o Add the three-state "outside" property to allow forcing an outside quote.
  In the default state, the outside must be decided by the space between
  the extension lines: if greather than 3 x arrow size => inside arrows.
o Implement the outside arrows in AdgLDim.
o Add AdgADim, the angular dimension.
o Add AdgXatch deriving AdgPath.


Road to adg-0.5.0
=================

o Change building scripts to get the Gtk+ dependency optional.
o Add AdgLayout, a GtkLayout derived class that could accept an AdgCanvas.
o Add AdgTitleBlock, a complex entity in paper space used to frame the
  sheet and show the general drawing data (title, scale, date and so on).


Road to unknown
===============

o Implement AdgModel and the model-view interaction.
o Implement AdgText, a generic text management, using pango.
