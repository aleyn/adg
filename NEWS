ADG 0.3.1
=========

Implemented the "invalidate" signal to force the cache recomputation
on a new rendering operation.

The new cairo "toy" API has been used to do text management in AdgDim.
This allows the caching of the intermediate glyphs for improved
performances (no profiling yet done). The cairo dependency raised to
version 0.7.4 or more.

The AdgLDim entity has been rewrote to full implement the new cache
design. Also other entities has been improved to allow a paper matrix
other than the default identity matrix.

ADG 0.3.0
=========

Reworked styles and implemented AdgContext, a clean and well defined
approach to manage rendering customization. 
 
Moved all the geometrical stuff in Cairo Path Manipulation Library (CPML),
an internal library depending only on cairo. 
  
Greatly improved documentation.

ADG 0.2.2
=========

Strongly separated model and paper matrix concepts and updated their
management using nested transformations. 
 
Reworked the rendering process in a cleaner way by propagating the
"render" signal and using internal entity states to let the application
know what changed from the previous rendering. 

ADG 0.2.1
=========

Reworked the sources tree in a cleaner way (to help future development)
and used private structs instead of populating the instance structure.
 
ADG 0.2.0
=========
 
This is the first public release of the ADG library. It is in a early stage of
developement, but the goal is quite ambitious!
  
The ADG library is based on cairo (http://cairographics.org) and glib-2.0
(http://www.gtk.org), found in any decent linux system.  Furthermore, I based
the container/child relationship on my little gcontainer library
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/gcontainer/): you must download and install
it first.
