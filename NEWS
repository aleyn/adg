ADG v.0.2.0 released
====================
 
This is the first public release of the ADG library. It is in a early stage of
developement, but the goal is quite ambitious!
  
The ADG library is based on Cairo (http://cairographics.org) and glib-2.0
(http://www.gtk.org), found in any decent linux system.  Furthermore, I based the
container/child relationship on the little gcontainer library
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/gcontainer/): you must download and install it first.

A lot of help needed ... feel free to contact me.
